# Encapsulation



### Simple exercice to reinforce the concepts of encapsulation

1. Create a Person class with private fields for name (String), age (int) and email (String)
2. Provide a constructor to initialize these fields
3. Implement public getter and setter methods for each field
4. Add a method printDetails() that prints the person's information
```java
//Some important concepts 
// Private access modifiers
public class MyClass
private int myField
```

## You want to run it your-self?
